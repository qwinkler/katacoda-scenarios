The following manifest is an example of a Pod which consists of a **single** container running the imageÂ `nginx:1.21`.

<pre class="file" data-filename="pod.yml" data-target="replace">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx

  containers:
  - name: nginx

</pre>

Let's deploy this Pod. We need the `apply` sub-command which will simply apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin:  

`kubectl apply --filename ./pod.yml`{{execute}}

To see the list of a Pods, run: `kubectl get pod`{{execute}}.  
To see the detailed information about the Pod, run: `kubectl describe pod nginx`{{execute}}.  

Okay, let's verify our Pod status: `kubectl get pod`{{execute}}.  
The ready column must show `1/1`.  

We can access to the any Pod in the cluster using `exec` command right from our local machine. No matter on which node the Pod is running.  
To do so, run the following command: `kubectl exec -it nginx -- bash`{{execute}}.  
Let's verify, that nginx works: `curl http://localhost`{{execute}}.  
To exit from the container run the `exit` command.

Cleanup. You can delete the Pod with different maner:  
- Delete the resources by their kind + name: `kubectl delete pod nginx`{{execute}};
- Delete the resources by filenames: `kubectl delete --filename ./pod.yml`{{execute}}.

If you deploy a lot of resources, it is convinient to use the second approach, but it's up to you.

Since the Pod shares storage and network resources between all of the containers, you can be very flexible with your configuration. You can pre-initialize your Pod before running the main image using [initContainers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/). You can gracefully stop your Pod or run the command right after the Pod was started using [`preStop` and `postStart` hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks), and many many more. In most of the cases, you will never use it, but keep in mind, that you can do literally everything to run your application smoothly in the Kubernetes cluster. For all of the available options please read the Kubernetes Documantation.

To summarize:

- Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes;
- Pods shares storage and network resources;
- Pod is a set of containers and it has a lot of features.
