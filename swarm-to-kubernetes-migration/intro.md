Before continuing, please, make sure you finished the [`swarm-repetition` scenario](https://www.katacoda.com/qwinkler/scenarios/swarm-repetition).

These exercises have been tests in theKubernetes cluster that is set up for you here in Katacoda, but you should also be able to run the same exercises using the Kubernetes support in Docker for Mac/Windows, Minikube or any other Kubernetes deployment tool supported on your laptop.
